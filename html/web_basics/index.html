<h1> Wassup world?</h1>
	<p>This is a paragraph about <strong>cats</strong>. Cats get to sleep all day and that sometimes make me very <em>jealous</em>. 
	Other things that make me jealous of cats include:
	<ul>
		<li>They don't pay rent.</li>
		<li>They can jump many times their size.</li>
		<li>They're not afraid of mice.</li>
		<li>They don't pay rent, dang it.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>

	<p>If I had a cat, though, I would give it a cool name. Some possible cat names are:
	<ol>
		<li>Fluffy</li>
		<li>Felix</li>
		<li>Tom</li>
		<li>Sprinkles</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
