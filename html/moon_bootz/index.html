<p>Since the invention of jump shoes, great strides have been made in their quality and technology.</p>

<p>If you remember the original flimsy jump pads that were made to be attached to regular shoes, you know that they were are not all that fun, and they were not really that safe.</p>

<p>Now, more than half a century later, todays jump shoes look nothing like the original version. The perfected version looks a lot more like a roller skate on a stable platform, designed to hold your feet in and provide a maximum bounce.</p>

<p>Adults often use them for athletic training.</p>

<p>They are an excellent way to get fit, and to practice for athletic competitions. They also have the added benefit of being a lot of fun, and there is no such thing as growing out of simple pleasures. Children will get the health benefits that come along with a more active lifestyle, and they will have fun bouncing.</p>

<p>Everyone can use a pair of bounce shoes, but it is hard to tell which ones are truly the best.</p>
