Take the user's word. 
Separate the user's word into an array.
Create a new array the same length as the word array. Fill it with dashes.
Ask the other user to enter a letter to guess.
If the letter is correct, place it into the new array at the same index as in the
	original array. Display the new array, now with the correct letter showing.
