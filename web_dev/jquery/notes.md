**Learning jQuery plan:**
- Find a cheat sheet
- Find a video tutorial on the basics
- Create the smallest possible program that jquery can be used on
	- Look for the very easy things to do and try some of them one by one

**What worked best**
- What actually ended up working best for me was a test based tutorial on W3 Schools. It went 
section by sectin explaining the basics of JQuery in small chunks of information and had actual
code examples that could be run and played with.
