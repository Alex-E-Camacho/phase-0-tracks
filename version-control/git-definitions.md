# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control allows one to track the progress of file(s) through its history. Instead of just seeing a file and not knowing how or when revisions were made, one can go back through its history and see when changes were made. This is helpful because in cases where some addition/subtraction casued bugs, one can pinpoint which changes most likely affected the files. 

* What is a branch and why would you use one?

A branch is a copy of a file/folder that allows you to manipulate information in it without affecting the original files/folders. You would use one to see the outcome of changes to the original files (master) and make sure they don't cause problems before you merge them to the original file/folder.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?

A commit is a save point in the process of writing/editing code so that you can return to an earlier version in case the current version is problematic. A good commit message clearly expresses what was added/altered since the previous commit. 

* What is a merge conflict?

A merge conflict is when two or more changes to the same file in two or more branches results in an inbalance of the intended effects of the changes when the versions of the files are integrated into one.
